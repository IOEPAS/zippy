      "WASHINGTON, June 25 -- For the first time since the end of the Clinton \n",
      "administration, California and the companies that sell it electricity sat at \n",
      "the same table today to try to resolve a multibillion-dollar feud over the \n",
      "state's energy bills. \n",
      "California is demanding that power companies refund as much as $9 billion for \n",
      "what it says were overcharges, while power companies say that the state's \n",
      "nearly insolvent utilities owe them billions of dollars. City and state \n",
      "officials from across the West are also participating in the negotiations.\n",
      "The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission convened the talks, which are \n",
      "scheduled to last up to two weeks. The sessions are the first since top \n",
      "Clinton administration officials tried and failed to broker a settlement to \n",
      "California's electricity crisis in their waning days in office. \n",
      "''The time to put California's past energy problems to rest and structure a \n",
      "new arrangement for California's energy future is now,'' said Curtis Wagner, \n",
      "an administrative law judge for the energy commission who is presiding over \n",
      "the settlement talks. \n",
      "The proceeding, which was standing-room-only on opening day, attracted scores \n",
      "of people representing multiple sides in the dispute. The main participants \n",
      "are electricity generating companies, electric utilities, and public \n",
      "officials from state and local governments and regulatory agencies. \n",
      "Mr. Wagner urged the public officials and companies involved to reach an \n",
      "agreement on how much California and other states in the Western grid should \n",
      "have paid for power over the last year, when California's partly deregulated \n",
      "market broke down. He said that if they failed to do so by July 10, he would \n",
      "recommend a solution to the energy agency's five commissioners, who would \n",
      "then have the option of imposing a settlement. \n",
      "Wholesale power costs in California, which totaled $7 billion in 1999, soared \n",
      "to about $27 billion last year and, by some state estimates, could double \n",
      "again this year. The higher costs, which have not been fully passed along to \n",
      "consumers, have rendered California's two main utility companies unable to \n",
      "pay their bills and forced the state to buy power in their place. \n",
      "The opening bid by Gov. Gray Davis, who set out his views in a letter sent to \n",
      "the energy commission today, is that the leading electricity generators \n",
      "should refund about $9 billion that ''they have overcharged the people of the \n",
      "state of California.'' Michael Kahn, chairman of the California Independent \n",
      "System Operator, is leading the state delegation. \n",
      "Generating companies have dismissed that figure as grossly inflated. They \n",
      "acknowledge that prices are high. But they say the charges are linked to \n",
      "shortages of natural gas, a crucial fuel for electricity generation, and were \n",
      "set fairly in a free market. \n",
      "The companies also contend that a large proportion of what they have billed \n",
      "California is a credit premium justified because wobbly utilities owe them as \n",
      "much as $15 billion. Reliant Energy, Duke Energy, the Williams Companies, the \n",
      "Enron Corporation and the Mirant Corporation are among the major sellers of \n",
      "electricity in the Western region. \n",
      "The energy commission, which has the duty of determining ''just and \n",
      "reasonable'' electricity prices under a New Deal-era law, long ago found that \n",
      "the California market had become dysfunctional and that prices were \n",
      "unjustified. But the agency has struggled to come up with a method for \n",
      "determining fair rates, changing its method three times in recent months. \n",
      "So far, the agency has identified about $125 million in potential \n",
      "overcharges. But that number was reached using a restrictive method that the \n",
      "agency has since abandoned. \n",
      "Last week, the agency adopted a new price control regime that is intended to \n",
      "limit price spikes throughout the West. If the controls it is using now were \n",
      "retroactively applied to electricity sales made over the last year, the \n",
      "generators would be asked to refund much more money. By some estimates, the \n",
      "refunds could total more than $1 billion but seem likely to fall well short \n",
      "of the $9 billion California is seeking.\n",

      "California?s energy crisis, residents are bracing for more rolling blackouts \n",
      "this summer. And while the nation?s energy prices on the whole are starting \n",
      "to decline, it?s clear that fossil fuels won?t light our homes and cool our \n",

      "Even President Bush, a loyal oilman, understands this reality. While pushing \n",

      "new, alternative-energy sources. \n",
      "Of course, there?s still no consensus on what those sources will be, and this \n",
      "is a high-risk game. Investors who pick correctly from among the leading \n",
      "possibilities could find themselves sitting on a gusher during the next \n",

      "commercially viable technologies. \n",
      "And even the long-term winners among these stocks (if there are any) can be \n",
      "counted on to deliver some major volatility in the meantime. The blame for \n",
      "that goes to the California crisis, whose twists and turns drive \n",

      "appears that the California panic is being solved, these stocks tend to trade \n",
      "down, so the sentiment is shifting on a daily basis,\" says Christine Farkas, \n",
      "a Merrill Lynch energy analyst. \n",
      "For adventurous investors who find such prospects electrifying, the most \n",
      "promising technology at this point seems to be the fuel cell, a device that \n",
      "extracts hydrogen from fossil fuels such as natural gas or coal and converts \n",
      "it into electricity. Environmentalists love fuel cells because the byproducts \n",
      "of the electrochemical process - mostly heat and water vapor - include few \n",
      "harmful emissions, especially when compared with what?s put out by internal \n",
      "combustion engines. \n",
      "Right now, the fuel-cell sector is crowded, with different companies at \n",
      "different stages of the product-development cycle aiming for different \n",
      "end-users. While some are building smaller fuel-cell systems to power cars, \n",
      "others are constructing large fuel-cell-powered plants that can meet the \n",
      "electricity needs of huge factories. Still others are targeting residential \n",
      "uses. Which ones are likely to emerge as leaders? One may be FuelCell Energy \n",
      "(FCEL). According to Chief Executive Jerry Leitman, the Danbury, Conn.-based \n",
      "fuel-cell developer expects to start booking orders by year?s end for its \n",
      "first product, a 300-kilowatt power plant roughly the size of a semi-trailer \n",
      "that can light up the equivalent of 100 homes. Quieter and more mobile than \n",
      "traditional electricity generators, the fuel-cell-powered plants can be \n",
      "located closer to commercial and industrial customers, such as hospitals and \n",
      "office buildings. Eventually, FuelCell plans to roll out 1.5 megawatt and \n",
      "three megawatt units. Investors seem to like what they see. FuelCell?s stock \n",
      "price, while highly volatile, has jumped 76% over the past year. (By \n",
      "contrast, fuel-cell rival Plug Power?s (PLUG) residential products are \n",
      "further from retail reality - and its stock is down 65% in the past 12 \n",
      "months. The same goes for Ballard Power Systems (BLDP), a Canadian firm \n",
      "targeting the auto industry, whose shares have lost 50% in the last year.) \n",
      "Earlier this month, FuelCell netted $241.5 million through a secondary stock \n",

      "manufacturing capacity to between 400 megawatts and 500 megawatts, a goal he \n",
      "expects to reach in 2004. \"That puts us into a profitable position when we \n",
      "get to that 400 to 500 megawatts of production,\" he says. (Leitman declined \n",
      "to offer more specific profit projections.) Merrill Lynch expects the company \n",
      "to hit 400 megawatts of capacity in 2004 or 2005, with profitability coming \n",
      "in 2005. In the interim, however, the earnings picture isn?t pretty. For its \n",
      "second quarter ended April 30, FuelCell booked just $6.5 million in revenues \n",
      "and posted a net loss of $5.1 million. \n",
      "FuelCell investors were reminded about quickly shifting sentiment last \n",
      "Tuesday. During a hearing over state funding of an Enron (ENE) fuel-cell \n",
      "project in Connecticut, opponents of the plan suggested the money could be \n",
      "better spent on other power endeavors. As a result FuelCell, which would \n",
      "supply fuel cells to the power-plant project, saw its shares fall 17% to \n",

      "federal and state regulators with one of their knottiest problems: Who \n",
      "controls the nation's power grid? \n",
      "On one side is a new breed of freewheeling energy dealers called merchant \n",
      "traders, spurred by deregulation to generate and trade electricity. Led here \n",
      "by Enron Corp., they build small gas-fired generating plants, but most don't \n",
      "construct their own power lines. Instead, they hook up the plants to existing \n",
      "lines and sell electricity wholesale over long distances when prices peak \n",
      "during the summer. Thus, many of their plants are called \"peakers.\" \n",
      "On the other side are old-line utilities, represented here by the federally \n",
      "owned Tennessee Valley Authority. They operate the power lines and warn that \n",
      "the system could become overloaded, leading to blackouts from the imbalance. \n",
      "Near Nutbush here in Tennessee's southwest corner, natural-gas pipelines run \n",
      "from the Gulf Coast and intersect with some of the TVA's 17,000 miles of \n",
      "transmission lines, which are spread over seven Southern states. That is what \n",
      "is making Nutbush boom: It is an attractive place to connect to the grid. \n",
      "By 2003, at least 13 new merchant plants altogether will be hooked up across \n",
      "the TVA's system. There will be dozens more on neighboring systems that will \n",
      "also use TVA lines, says W. Terry Boston, a TVA executive vice president. \n",
      "This year, TVA expects 300,000 requests for wholesale power deals on its \n",
      "system, up from 250,000 last year and just 25,000 in 1996. Mr. Boston \n",
      "foresees a congestion problem that will make it more difficult for the \n",
      "utility to maintain its record of 99% reliability. \"This summer is going to \n",
      "be interesting,\" he says. \n",
      "Combat started here in the spring of 1999, when an Enron plant at nearby \n",
      "Brownsville began bombarding TVA with about 800 requests for summer \n",
      "transmission service, up from 33 the TVA had received from merchant plants \n",
      "the year before. Some were huge, elaborate trades involving brokered \n",
      "electricity from other sources that Enron wanted to ship across the TVA \n",
      "system. Kevin Presto, an Enron vice president, recalled: The TVA \"pretty much \n",
      "fought us the whole way, even though they needed the megawatts.\" \n",
      "That June, TVA pulled the plug, telling Enron that from then on, its wheeling \n",
      "and dealing would be confined to the amount of electricity produced in Enron \n",
      "plants. Enron claimed foul and appealed to the North American Electric \n",
      "Reliability Council, or NERC,, a voluntary organization of utilities and \n",
      "electricity consumers. Along with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission \n",
      "and state regulators, NERC functions as the traffic cop for North America's \n",
      "power grid. \n",
      "Enron also sued the TVA and the dispute \"raised a number of issues that we \n",
      "are trying to put our fingers on,\" says Don Benjamin, NERC's director of \n",
      "operations. One upshot is that it is busy rewriting the rules for how the \n",
      "national grid is controlled. The Bush administration's energy task force and \n",
      "Congress are also looking at the control issue and ways to expand the grid's \n",
      "capacity. So far, they have found no easy or inexpensive answers. \n",
      "The grid, with its dense webs surrounding major cities and few links in \n",
      "between, resembles a U.S. highway map from the 1930s before the Interstate \n",
      "system was built. And it is governed by rules that were negotiated by \n",
      "utilities at about that time, as they began to interconnect their systems \n",
      "with their neighbors'. Big utilities became \"control areas\" that perform the \n",
      "moment-to-moment adjustments that keep lines from overloading and equipment \n",
      "from melting down. With electricity, supply must always match demand. But \n",
      "lately, operators of merchant plants, such as Enron, have also qualified to \n",
      "become control areas. Regulators have ordered utilities to give merchant \n",
      "power plants open access to the grid, though the utilities sometimes curtail \n",
      "access for \"reliability\" reasons. \n",
      "\"This was a very good system,\" sighs Thomas Overbye, an engineering professor \n",
      "at the University of Illinois. But while merchant plants have more access to \n",
      "the grid, he notes, they have little incentive to build more power lines. \n",
      "\"When you restructure that way,\" asserts Mr. Overbye. \"You're going to \n",
      "overload the system, and that's exactly what's happening.\" \n",
      "NERC's Mr. Benjamin worries that control will get harder this summer. \"We've \n",
      "got to be able to look at this and see what effects these deals are having on \n",
      "the whole system,\" he says. Some ad hoc curtailment of wholesale deals and \n",
      "service to customers may be necessary to protect the grid, but the result \n",
      "will be expensive, he notes. \"It means that merchants won't make money on \n",
      "that deal, and that the customer they sold power to will have to buy it from \n",
      "somebody else.\" In the summer of 1999 there were such 70 curtailments; last \n",
      "summer there were 180. \n",
      "Lynn Church, president of the Electric Power Supply Association, which \n",
      "represents 40 merchant power companies and electricity traders, suspects that \n",
      "decisions taken by big utilities for \"reliability\" reasons are sometimes used \n",
      "to block legitimate competition from her members. To prevent this, her group \n",
      "wants more federal control over the grid. \"We're seeing lots of \n",
      "discrimination.\" The TVA's Mr. Boston counters that his system can't take \n",
      "more \"surprises,\" such as the one on Aug. 19, 1999, when a series of \n",
      "wholesale trades brought the TVA's part of the grid to the brink of collapse \n",
      "from the overload. \n",
      "This year, Enron settled its fight with the TVA with a secret out-of-court \n",
      "settlement. Enron says it is also in the process of selling the plant near \n",
      "here and two others it had hooked to the TVA system to other merchant power \n",
      "producers. But it is still waging war over who controls the grid. \n",
      "In a separate case now before the U.S. Supreme Court, Enron argues that FERC \n",
      "has the power to open more of the grid's capacity to merchant power plants. \n",
      "Utility commissioners from several states argue it doesn't. While this is \n",
      "going on, FERC is pondering how to cut back the grid's proliferating number \n",
      "of control areas. Right now there are about 150. According to one FERC \n",
      "expert, who asked not to be identified, to avoid \"complications\" there should \n",
      "be around 14. \n",
      "Meanwhile, officials in Tina Turner's home turf still want the power plant \n",
      "construction to keep on rocking. \"There's going to be others,\" predicts John \n",
      "Sharpe, the executive of Haywood County, who has been out recruiting more \n",
      "power plants to keep the local economic boost going. \"I'm working my pants \n",

      "California has any lesson for Ontario, it is that new power generating \n",
      "capacity is essential to meet rising demand. Delays in opening the market and \n",

      "fashionable economic theory is that OPG should be broken up to create a \n",

      "instituted such forced rankings or gotten tougher with their existing \n",

      "most U.S. employees, and last fall Hewlett-Packard decreed that a full 5% of \n",
      "its work force would receive HP's lowest grade, rather than the fuzzy 0 to 5% \n",

      "Proponents of forced rankings argue that they facilitate budgeting and guard \n",

      "a professor of industrial psychology at the University of South Florida. \n",
      "Most companies guard against this problem by refraining from rigidly applying \n",
      "the distribution to smaller teams--but that means the spread has to be made \n",
      "up somewhere else. The result: Different managers spend hours haggling with \n",
      "one another to meet the overall distribution requirements. This horse-trading \n",
      "process can be frustrating and time-consuming, one Microsoft middle manager \n",
      "says. While Bill Zolna, a Microsoft spokesperson, denies that the company \n",

      "the middle manager says that there is unspoken pressure to do so. \n",

      "more easily rationalize firings. In his latest message to GE shareholders, \n",

      "renewable fuels like wood chips. And the plant is a model of affordability. \n",
      "While other energy prices rise, District Energy has not raised its heating \n",

      "rules of the gas market, critics say, encourage sellers and traders -- \n",
      "including the biggest local gas utility -- to drive prices higher. \n",
      "At peak times, half of California's electricity is generated by gas-fired \n",
      "power plants, a higher proportion than in most parts of the country. And \n",
      "because 85 percent of the gas consumed in California comes from outside the \n",
      "state, the shortage of pipelines both into California and within the state \n",
      "has become a big handicap in fueling those plants. The strain has become \n",
      "especially acute as drought in the Pacific Northwest has curtailed imports of \n",
      "hydropower and gas-fired power plants have worked overtime to meet the \n",
      "demands of a booming state economy. \n",
      "Vice President Dick Cheney's energy policy report last month proposed \n",
      "initiatives to speed approval and construction of new pipelines, noting that \n",
      "New England and other regions faced capacity squeezes, too. The report says \n",
      "that the United States needs 38,000 miles of new gas transmission pipelines, \n",
      "almost a 20 percent increase. \n",
      "In the meantime, some industry executives and public officials take the \n",
      "argument one step further than the Bush administration, contending that \n",
      "today's shortage of capacity has made it possible for energy companies, \n",
      "intent on maximizing profits, to manipulate prices. \n",
      "''It really strains credulity to say this is a functioning market,'' said \n",
      "Representative Joe Barton, Republican of Texas, who as chairman of the House \n",
      "energy subcommittee has been leaning on the Federal Energy Regulatory \n",
      "Commission to scrutinize the California gas market. ''Reasonable people could \n",
      "conclude people have gamed the system.'' \n",
      "In one significant case, California utility regulators and Southern \n",
      "California Edison, one of the state's struggling electric utilities, have \n",
      "accused the El Paso Corporation of using its control of a major pipeline into \n",
      "the state to inflate prices artificially. El Paso officials deny wrongdoing \n",
      "and accuse California officials of making the company a scapegoat for the \n",
      "state's failure to build more pipelines. A judge at the federal energy \n",
      "commission is hearing the case in Washington. \n",
      "But fingers are pointing in other directions, too. \n",
      "For example, the Southern California Gas Company, the state's largest gas \n",
      "utility, has reaped huge profits buying and selling gas in the last year -- \n",
      "activity encouraged by state regulations intended to lower gas prices for \n",
      "consumers. But some gas marketers and electricity generators contend that the \n",
      "trading has contributed to price spikes, by tying up valuable pipeline space \n",
      "during peak times with gas shipments driven by financial deals, not power \n",
      "demands. \n",
      "At the same time, Edison says that Southern California Gas failed to put \n",
      "enough gas into storage last fall for residential and small-business \n",
      "customers. If so, that would have driven the gas company back into the market \n",
      "in the winter, when demand from power plant operators was high, helping push \n",
      "gas -- and hence electricity -- prices yet higher, Edison complains. \n",
      "Between them, El Paso and Southern California Gas were responsible for $3.7 \n",
      "billion in excess prices for energy in the last year, Edison contends. \n",
      "Southern California Gas, a unit of Sempra Energy, denies that its trading has \n",
      "harmed the market. Rather, its executives note that electricity generators \n",
      "and industrial gas consumers -- which under state rules are responsible for \n",
      "managing their own gas supplies -- put very little gas into storage last \n",
      "year. By one estimate, large gas consumers in Southern California had only 11 \n",
      "percent as much gas in storage at the end of November as they did at the same \n",
      "time during the prior two years. \n",
      "Another problem may emerge this summer, according to William L. Massey, a \n",
      "member of the federal energy commission. Mr. Massey said new commission rules \n",
      "intended to limit electricity price spikes in California will almost \n",
      "certainly prompt energy-trading companies -- which deal in both gas and \n",
      "electricity -- to manipulate gas prices. That is because the rules allow \n",
      "electricity generators to charge more if gas prices move higher. \n",
      "Similarly, growing attention is being paid to the role played by financial \n",
      "trading tied to the price of electricity and natural gas. Industry critics \n",
      "question whether huge trading volumes in these financial derivatives gives \n",
      "energy marketing companies the incentive to manipulate prices in tight \n",
      "markets. \n",
      "Federal regulators ''don't seem to understand that firms are really trying to \n",
      "make as much money as they can,'' said Severin Borenstein, director of the \n",
      "University of California Energy Institute, a research organization on the \n",
      "Berkeley campus. ''That's what they do for a living.'' \n",
      "Fixing the problem is simple, Mr. Borenstein said. ''If you build more \n",
      "capacity,'' he said, ''you reduce both the scarcity issue and you reduce the \n",
      "ability of people who currently own capacity to exercise market power.'' \n",
      "Regardless of whether companies are manipulating prices, the California \n",
      "natural gas market is fattening bottom lines. In the El Paso case, testimony \n",
      "has shown that pipeline capacity acquired by the company's marketing \n",
      "affiliate in March 2000 for $38.5 million produced profits of almost $900 \n",
      "million over the next 13 months. \n",
      "El Paso said its share of those profits was $184 million, the rest going to \n",
      "other companies with which it entered into hedging transactions intended to \n",
      "limit El Paso's exposure if gas prices fell. About half of those transactions \n",
      "were with the biggest energy trader, the Enron Corporation, according to \n",
      "people present at briefings El Paso officials have given to California \n",
      "officials. \n",
      "An Enron spokesman, Mark Palmer, said it was possible that Enron took the \n",
      "other side of the trades, but he said that Enron would have resold the \n",
      "pipeline capacity almost immediately, thus profiting little from the rise of \n",
      "gas prices in California. \n",
      "Federal regulators, concerned that the high gas prices in California may not \n",
      "be legitimate, have proposed requiring companies selling gas in the state to \n",
      "disclose extensive data about their transactions. They are also considering \n",
      "whether to reimpose price caps on short-term sales of pipeline capacity that \n",
      "were eliminated early last year. \n",
      "Further, regulators are scrutinizing the so-called gray market in which \n",
      "energy marketers bundle gas and transmission capacity and sell it to large \n",
      "customers, like electricity generators, for one price. Federal regulators \n",
      "have oversight responsibility for the interstate portion of gas shipments, \n",
      "but they have not looked closely at these bundled transactions, Mr. Massey \n",
      "said. \n",
      "''The whole thing has fallen through the cracks,'' he said. \n",
      "Nearly all of California's gas comes from the Southwest, the Rocky Mountain \n",
      "states and Canada through a few huge, highly pressurized pipelines. In \n",
      "California, the gas is shunted onto intrastate pipelines that deliver it to \n",
      "consumers and to underground storage fields for later use. \n",
      "Those pipelines are now largely running full, and their capacity is about 300 \n",
      "million cubic feet a day less than what interstate pipelines can deliver. The \n",
      "difference is the amount of gas it takes to continuously fuel a 1,300 \n",
      "megawatt power plant -- enough to light more than a million homes. \n",
      "''It's not resources, it's straws -- the straws needed to suck this gas where \n",
      "it needs to go,'' said Thom Kelly, assistant executive director of the \n",
      "California Energy Commission. ''If the straws are full, that's a problem.'' \n",
      "Operators of interstate pipelines have proposed new construction that could \n",
      "double delivery to the state. Indeed, odd as it seems now, some in the \n",
      "industry worry that California could be ''overpiped'' later this decade, just \n",
      "as it was in the mid-1990's. \n",
      "Likewise, Southern California Gas plans only limited expansion of its \n",
      "in-state pipelines, partly because it expects demand to fall as hydroelectric \n",
      "power supplies return to normal levels and older, less efficient gas-fired \n",
      "power plants are phased out. \n",
      "But the gas company's intentions are regarded with skepticism by others in \n",
      "the industry. Some executives contend that Southern California Gas has \n",
      "damaged the marketplace through its enthusiastic embrace of a state program \n",
      "that allows it to split with customers the profits from buying, selling and \n",
      "lending gas. \n",
      "A coalition of power generators, including Reliant Energy, the Williams \n",
      "Companies and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, has complained \n",
      "to state officials that the program ''creates perverse incentives'' for the \n",
      "gas company. The generators say it results in extra demand for pipeline space \n",
      "when capacity already is at a premium, making prices more volatile. \n",
      "The consequences of the gas company's low storage inventories were evident in \n",
      "early December, according to John Stout, a senior Reliant executive. He \n",
      "recalled listening in on a conference call as a Southern California Gas \n",
      "official talked about injecting gas into storage. ''I was floored,'' Mr. \n",
      "Stout said. ''Prices were sky high, and they were putting more upward \n",
      "pressure on prices.'' \n",
      "Lee M. Stewart, president of energy transportation services for Southern \n",
      "California Gas, called the criticism ''bogus.'' The utility's storage and \n",
      "trading practices have neither hurt the market nor curtailed gas sales to \n",
      "customers, he said. \n",
      "''To say gas prices drive electricity prices is a falsehood,'' Mr. Stewart \n",
      "added. \n",
      "But to many regulators, it is clear that gas prices play an increasingly \n",
      "important role in electricity prices. \n",
      "Problems in the California natural gas markets ''haven't been given the \n",

      "Federal regulators have launched yet another attempt to control California's \n",
      "out-of-control wholesale electricity market. But like previous efforts, it \n",
      "could have limited effectiveness. \n",
      "Already, critics are predicting failure for the new \"price mitigation\" plan \n",
      "that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission put into effect last week. The \n",
      "FERC's pricing plan is again \"laced with loopholes,\" says California Gov. \n",
      "Gray Davis, who says that \"it's worse than too little, too late.\"\n",
      "Backers say the new initiative is more comprehensive and less susceptible to \n",
      "manipulation by power suppliers than previous efforts. They note that some \n",
      "electricity prices fell last week following implementation of the order. A \n",
      "spokeswoman for the California Independent System Operator, which runs the \n",
      "state's transmission grid and has been critical of the new FERC plan, says it \n",
      "is too early for her organization to evaluate the initiative's impact. \n",
      "FERC's new plan attempts to control prices during periods of relatively tight \n",
      "supply. In contrast to previous controls that had specific dollar targets, \n",
      "the new plan uses a fluctuating market price derived from production costs at \n",
      "California plants. Prices above this benchmark will be subject to FERC review \n",
      "and possible refunds by suppliers. \n",
      "The price-control efforts have been prompted by a botched 1996 California \n",
      "utility-deregulation plan that contributed to leaving the state with \n",
      "extremely tight power supplies. In May 2000, wholesale electricity prices \n",
      "began soaring. Power that previously fetched $20 to $40 a megawatt hour began \n",
      "trading for hundreds of dollars. \n",
      "Officials first tried price caps. For example, caps ranging from $750 down to \n",
      "$250 a megawatt hour have been in place at various times on the power that \n",
      "the ISO buys, at the last minute, to avoid shortages. During several hundred \n",
      "hours last summer, it appeared that the caps restrained some electricity \n",
      "prices from going higher, according to a recent study by the California State \n",
      "Auditor. \n",
      "The market became progressively tougher to control, though. Under the state's \n",
      "deregulation design, the vast majority of the power needs was to be purchased \n",
      "a day ahead of time. As the crisis worsened last year, suppliers and buyers \n",
      "began to see economic advantages from doing more transactions in the ISO \n",
      "real-time, last-minute market. Eventually, more than a quarter of the \n",
      "system's electricity needs were, at times, obtained through the ISO market, \n",
      "far more than ever anticipated. \n",
      "Having so many last-minute purchases endangered the reliability of the \n",
      "transmission system. To discourage transactions in the last-minute market, \n",
      "officials began ratcheting down the price cap there, lowering it to $250 in \n",
      "August. \n",
      "But suppliers apparently found ways to avoid the tighter cap. One such method \n",
      "is known as \"megawatt laundering.\" Since the caps didn't apply to power \n",
      "coming from out-of-state suppliers, California generators had an incentive to \n",
      "sell power to a purchaser in another state, who could then quickly sell back \n",
      "the juice through the ISO at whatever the market would bear. \n",
      "After the ISO price cap went down to $250, so-called out-of-market \n",
      "transactions, which include out-of-state power purchases, soared to an \n",
      "average of 5,000 megawatts an hour by early December from almost nothing. At \n",
      "the same time, sales through the ISO's real-time market fell to a trickle. \n",
      "Prices of the out-of-market transactions in December averaged $461 a megawatt \n",
      "hour, nearly twice the price cap. \n",
      "Part of this surge might be explained by a sharp rise in the cost of natural \n",
      "gas, a major power-plant fuel. As rising fuel costs pushed up generating \n",
      "costs, producers had an added incentive for avoiding the California price \n",
      "caps, say some observers. \n",
      "Several state and federal investigations are looking for evidence of illegal \n",
      "manipulation in the skyrocketing prices for natural gas and electricity. Much \n",
      "electricity is sent out of state under perfectly proper, long-term \n",
      "arrangements. Even \"megawatt laundering,\" though a pejorative phrase, isn't \n",
      "necessarily illegal unless it is part of a concerted effort to drive up \n",
      "market prices, say state and federal officials. \n",
      "Spurred by the rapid rise in out-of-market transactions, ISO officials \n",
      "abandoned the price cap in December. FERC then approved a \"soft cap\" \n",
      "price-control plan. Sales made at more than $150 a megawatt hour were subject \n",
      "to FERC review and possible refund orders if the price was found to be too \n",
      "far above the supplier's costs. So far, FERC has tentatively ordered over \n",
      "$100 million in refunds. Critics of that FERC soft cap say it was too \n",
      "generous in its calculations of production costs and far too limited in its \n",
      "scope. The cap only kicked in during a Stage 3 alert, when supplies were so \n",
      "tight that rolling blackouts were imminent. Some state officials and others \n",
      "argue that the FERC should be ordering billions of dollars in refunds for \n",
      "prices charged over the past year. \n",
      "The price-control feature of the new FERC plan covers more hours than the \n",
      "previous one but will still be restricted to times of relatively tight \n",
      "supply. Critics say controls should be in effect during all hours, since \n",
      "prices have often been high around the clock. \n",
      "Plus, the new plan still fails \"to take any constructive steps to eliminate \n",
      "or even to minimize the pernicious effects of `megawatt laundering,'\" says a \n",
      "recent ISO filing with the FERC. Out-of-state sales still aren't covered by \n",
      "the latest plan, which leaves suppliers with a large potential loophole for \n",
      "reaping higher power prices. The volume of out-of-market transactions has \n",
      "remained high this year. In April, the price for such deals averaged $372 a \n",
      "megawatt hour. \n",
      "Gov. Davis and others argue that price controls need to be extended \n",
      "throughout the Western U.S. In its decision unveiling the new control plan, \n",
      "FERC acknowledged that more may be needed on the laundering issue. It opened \n",
      "an investigation into sales transactions around the West. The terms of such \n",
      "sales, said the FERC decision, might not be \"just and reasonable.\" \n",

      "last week of June. \n",
      "However, the recently announced production cuts will bring mill operating \n",

      "crucial first step and should be commended for recognizing the importance of \n",
      "creating a healthy retail market for California consumers, AReM must note two \n",
      "specific concerns with the proposed plan.\n",
      "First, the plan fails to address small and residential customers' right to \n",
      "access the retail market. Certainly all consumers deserve the opportunity to \n",
      "take advantage of the benefits of retail energy options and to take control \n",
      "of their own energy futures. \n",
      "Second, the plan should not arbitrarily assign past debt costs to any one \n",
      "class. AReM suggests that any comprehensive solution be structured in a way \n",
      "that is fair for all parties. Any charges imposed to recover the costs of \n",
      "purchased power should be allocated to each customer group based on the costs \n",
      "that group has incurred. Without such fair allocations, the proposed plan may \n",
      "unintentionally create a barrier that discourages customers from utilizing \n",

      "also why are your bills going up. You're pretty lucky, actually, where you \n",

      "haven't deregulated yet. That is, they haven't tried to restructure the \n",

      "bills here in Atlanta have gone -- we've had taste of that. \n",
      "BERGMAN: Well, that's part of the documentary. Natural gas has usually been \n",
      "set up as the example, the deregulation example for the rest of the country, \n",
      "and the reason why we started to deregulate electricity. Now, with the great \n",
      "rise in cost nationally, people are beginning to scratch their heads, and I \n",
      "think that's one of the reasons we decided to do the show is because we never \n",
      "really had what we would call an intense national discussion of why were we \n",
      "doing this to these essential commodities that we all need. \n",
      "KAGAN: Well, let's talk about the deregulation. Story after story in \n",
      "California, you have people blaming deregulation. But what really is it, and \n",
      "what was it supposed to do and what went wrong? \n",
      "BERGMAN: Well, first of all, California went first, in 1996 with a plan that \n",
      "now everyone is disowning, but everyone voted in favor of unanimously at the \n",
      "time. Every political spectrum joined in wanting to change the nature of the \n",
      "marketplace. So, in many ways, California is a learning experience for the \n",
      "rest of the country, probably in some of the rules that don't make sense or \n",
      "in the end, didn't make sense. \n",
      "KAGAN: Why did it seem like a good idea back then? I mean, if all the people \n",
      "were in favor of it, then it must have looked good to a lot of people. \n",
      "BERGMAN: Well, because number one, the utilities were never our favorite \n",
      "monopoly in any of our communities. You know about Homer Simpson and \"Erin \n",
      "Brockovich\" and the image isn't exactly of companies that warm our heart. \n",
      "That combined with large users of electricity, big industry wanted to change \n",
      "the system so they would have an opportunity to go out in the open \n",
      "marketplace and buy power cheaper or so they thought. \n",
      "KAGAN: You mention, of course, that this is a story that touches all of us, \n",
      "anybody who electricity on in their home, unless it's like the folks that we \n",
      "featured before you who have their own power source. But how do you take \n",
      "that, Lowell, and how do you make it a good television story besides a bunch \n",
      "of pictures of power plants? \n",
      "BERGMAN: Well, what we found, what we discovered is that the deregulation of \n",
      "the industry has created a new kind of energy company, and the best example \n",
      "of that is Enron, based in Houston, Texas, and they were nice enough and \n",
      "cooperative in every way. So, they let us in to see what it is they do do. \n",
      "What is this new new energy business. \n",
      "For instance, Enron is the largest Internet business in the world. It has \n",
      "Enron Online, and on that site, it buys and sells tens of billions of dollars \n",
      "worth of electricity, gas and oil every year. This is a kind of marketplace \n",
      "that never existed before. So, one of the functions of a documentary is to \n",
      "try to open not only our eyes, the people doing it, the reporters, but also \n",
      "the public's eyes as to what has gone on. This is something that is \n",
      "well-known inside business communities nationally, but it's not well-known \n",
      "among most of us. So, that's one area. Another area that we get into is \n",
      "examining whether or not there was real manipulation by the energy generators \n",
      "in California, and nationally as well as the gas companies. \n",
      "KAGAN: Well, we will look for it. We will look for it tomorrow, sorry. The \n",
      "power on our interview here is running out. We ran out of time. Lowell \n",
      "Bergman, good luck with it. Most viewers will find it on their PBS station \n",
      "tomorrow night, correct? \n",

      "Moving that power from often remote plants to the biggest markets presents a \n",
      "challenge, particularly in four areas served by ERCOT, which manages 85 \n",
      "percent of the Texas power grid. \n",
      "\"You can't get it from there to here,\" Noel said of the trouble spots. \n",
      "Transmission constraints exist in moving power from the south to the north, \n",
      "where fast-growing Dallas creates a high demand; inside Dallas itself; from \n",
      "the Rio Grande Valley to Austin and San Antonio in Central Texas; and from \n",
      "lightly populated West Texas to the eastern half of the state. \n",
      "In the last case, several companies including Enron Corp. have committed to \n",

      "INCENTIVES TO BUILD TRANSMISSION \n",
      "Though companies have already anted up to erect power lines in the problem \n",
      "areas, the state will have to provide attractive rates of return to encourage \n",
      "continuing infrastructure investments, he said. \n",
      "\"The rate of return is going to have to be a little higher than it was in the \n",
      "past,\" Noel said. \n",
      "He expected that the Texas Public Utility Commission, which negotiates such \n",
      "rates with the utilities, would look to a range of 10-12 percent return on \n",
      "investment, as opposed to current rates in the neighborhood of eight percent. \n",
      "Transmission is the only major part of the state's electricity market which \n",
      "will still be regulated after retail deregulation kicks off, he said. The \n",
      "wholesale market has been deregulated since 1995. \n",
      "\"We believe the infrastructure has to be regulated,\" Noel said. \n",

      "get to market because they can't get to the lines,\" he said. \n",
      "Under the Texas deregulation plan, generators will sell power directly to \n",
      "customers but will send it via wires likely owned by other companies. That is \n",
      "part of the reason traditional regulated Texas utilities like TXU Corp. and \n",
      "Reliant Energy Inc. are splitting their regulated and unregulated businesses \n",
